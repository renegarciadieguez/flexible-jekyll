This first post will describe the steps required to setup and customize the a new GitHub Pages site using the theme
[flexible-jekyll](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll).

## Fork the repo ##
After forking the repo you'll need to go to your version of the repo's settings and publish the master branch. GitHub
will then show you the url for the site. In my case, https://renegarciadieguez.github.io/flexible-jekyll/.

Wait a few minutes. GitHub needs to build and deploy the pages.

## Making a post ##
The `_posts` directory contains a series of `.markdown` files. Delete all the files except for one. I'm my case, the one
I kept was renamed to `_posts/2020-11-19-setting-up-github-pages.markdown` and it resulted in the post you're reading.
